# ELISA Notes Repo
- Like with all good work, a strong theoretical foundation is essential to good algorithms.
- Here are my notes on ELISA, an experiment conducted by an old lab collaborator while i was an undergraduate.
- I have never performed ELISA's before but this is a good scenario to come up with some algorithms.
- The actual group of functions or packages i am putting together are meant to be generalized towards dose response experiments (dre) which will infact will infact have a very strong foundation thanks to others interested in this problem.
- This repo provides a very good foundation for people interested in ELISA theory and how the experiment works from the conceptual and benchtop approach.
